# Springbok is a Symfony 2 Ticket system.

Springbok is built to be future proof, with a focus on speed and cute stripes.

## Goals

While the primary goal is to gain experience working with Symfony 2 and MongoDB (or any document oriented db's), we do plan on creating a handy, fully functional ticket system. There will be comments, notifications, categories and tags.

## Technology

Springbok is built on:

* Symfony 2 - http://symfony-reloaded.org/
* MongoDB - http://www.mongodb.org/
* Baguettes - your local boulangerie
