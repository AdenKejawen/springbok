# Springbok

## Springbok is a Symfony 2 Ticket system

Yes, another ticket system. After twitter apps, the new hello world. Still, we think there is something to be gained by creating something new. First of all, we'll be focussing on new technologies. For instance, we're using a document-based persistance layer, as opposed to the traditional relational dbms. Symfony 2 is shaping up to be a serious contender in the php framework world, but is entirely new. In short, Springbok is built to be future proof, with a focus on speed and cute stripes.

## Goals

While the primary goal is to gain experience working with Symfony 2 and MongoDB
(or any document oriented db's), we do plan on creating a handy, fully
functional ticket system, including support for:

* multiple projects and subprojects
* composite tickets
* tags
* milestones
* user roles
* and much more!

## Technology

Springbok is built on:

* PHP 5.3 - http://php.net/
* Symfony 2 - http://symfony-reloaded.org/
* MongoDB - http://www.mongodb.org/
* Baguettes - your local boulangerie
